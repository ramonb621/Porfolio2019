                <p>My name is Ramon Barajas.  I grew up in Boyle Heights during the 90's.  As a kid, I loved chasing after ice cream trucks, playing Pokemon Yellow Version on my Gameboy, and watching cartoons.  As an adult my favorite pastimes aren't very different but they include collecting superhero memorabilia, watching the latest Marvel flicks, going to the gym, taking trips to the range, and cooking.  Whether I'm relaxing at home or driving around, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music ranging from anything like jazz to the latin pop I grew up listening to.  A random fact about me is that I have a huge soft spot for animals.  It's just one of the random things I inherited from my parents.</p>
                <p>Family is a huge motivator in why I do alot of the things I do.  My siblings and I didn't have much growing up but my parents did the best they could to provide for us.  Seeing their struggle to raise us and give us the best they could has taught me to be grateful for each opportunity I'm presented with and to always keep moving forward regardless of how hard I may fall.  </p>
