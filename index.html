                    <p>Hello, I'm Ramon. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer from Los Angeles who attended the UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp in 2019 and am currently enrolled at Rio Hondo College working on a CS degree.</p>
                    <p>Have a project you'd like to discuss? Please visit my<a href="contact.html"> contact</a> page.</p>
                    <!-- <p>Hello, I'm Ramon. I'm an LA native who grew up in Boyle Heights. I am a former EMT now Full-Stack Web developer who attended the UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp in 2019 and took some computer science courses at Rio Hondo College to try and expand my knowledge in hopes to make it in the industry. As a child I always had a passion for building things and discovering why things worked the way they did, which is partially why I decided to become a coder. I enjoy doing many things, most of which include collecting superhero memorabilia, watching the latest Marvel flicks, going to the gym, taking trips to the range, cooking, and coding.</p>
                    <p>Whether I'm relaxing at home or driving around the city, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music ranging from anything like jazz to the latin pop I grew up with.  A random fact about me is my love of animals.  I was fortunate to have a variety of pets growing up.  It's one of many interests I inherited from my parents.</p>
                    <p>Family is a huge motivator in why I do many of the things I do.  Seeing the struggle my parents went through to provide for their 4 children in a low-income household of the bad side of town has taught me to be grateful for each opportunity I'm presented with and to always keep moving forward regardless of how hard things get.  They taught me to take on as many challenges as I can handle and always strive for self-growth.</p> -->
