                <p>Welcome, my name is Ramon Barajas.  I'm an LA native who grew up in Boyle Heights in the 90's.  As a kid, I loved chasing after ice cream trucks, playing Pokemon Yellow Version on my Gameboy, and watching cartoons.  As an adult my favorite pastimes aren't very different but they include collecting superhero memorabilia, watching the latest Marvel flicks, going to the gym, taking trips to the range, cooking, and coding.</p>
                <p>Whether I'm relaxing at home or driving around the city, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music ranging from anything like jazz to the latin pop I grew up with.  A random fact about me is my love of animals.  I was fortunate to have a variety of pets growing up.  It's one of many interests I inherited from my parents.</p>
                <p>Family is a huge motivator in why I do alot of the things I do.  My siblings and I didn't have much growing up but my parents always did their best to provide for 4 kids.  Seeing their struggle to raise us and give us the things they could never have as children has taught me to be grateful for each opportunity I'm presented with and to always keep moving forward regardless of how hard I fall.  They taught me to take on as many challenges as I can handle and to strive for self-growth, which is why I decided to change my profession from working in healthcare to becoming a web developer.</p>
